This application stretches and compresses audio without altering the =
frequency
character of the audio. For reasonable factors, this application will =
scale
audio without altering signal levels or introducing artifacts.

Requirements :
This program requires an installed version of MFFM multimedia time code
handling classes. Try :
http://mffmtimecode.sourceforge.net/

Audio files are read and written using LibSndFile :
http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/

Finally you require a C++ compiler, try :
http://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html

Home Page :

MFFM Time Scale Modification for Audio is 2 things :
a] A compilable program WSOLATest.C which allow you to time stretch and =
compress
   mono audio files. Audio files are restricted to be mono 16 bit frame =
sized.
b] A set of 2 header files which are the implementation of [1].

For simple use ....
Type 'make' and compile the program WSOLATest

Run WSOLATest like so :
WSOLATest inputFile outputFile factor
factor =3D 0.5 for halving the duration of an audio file
factor =3D 2.0 for doubling the duration of an audio file
factor =3D 1.0 for an identical file.

	Abstract:
	A concept of waveform similarity for tackling the problem of=20
	time-scale modification of speech is proposed. It is worked=20
	out in the context of short-time Fourier transform representations.=20
	The resulting WSOLA (waveform-similarity-based synchronized=20
	overlap-add) algorithm produces high-quality speech output,=20
	is algorithmically and computationally efficient and robust, and=20
	allows for online processing with arbitrary time-scaling factors=20
	that may be specified in a time-varying fashion and can be chosen=20
	over a wide continuous range of values. </PRE></BODY></HTML>
